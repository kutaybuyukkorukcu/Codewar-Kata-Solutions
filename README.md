I solve(d) 8-7-6 kyu katas when i'm watching series, watching videos or playing games so they might not be the best solution. You might want to consider checking other people solutions.

Well my intention to create this repository is to start solving three kata per day and pushing some solutions at the same time.

I will update this page later on.
