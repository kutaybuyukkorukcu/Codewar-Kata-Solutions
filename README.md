I solve(d) 8-7-6 kyu katas when i'm watching a series, videos or playing games so they might not be the best solution. You might want to consider checking other people solutions.

Well my intention to create this repository is to start solving one kata per day and pushing some solutions per day.
Solutions are solved with Javascript, Java and Python. Starting from kyu 6 i wont use Java to solve katas. (I hope i wont need Java. I'm still learning javascript via solving katas)

I will update this page later.
