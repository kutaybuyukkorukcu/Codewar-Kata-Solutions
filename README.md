I started solving these catalogs (8 kyu) because I needed some simple algorithm problems to give homework to high school students. After I realized that Katas was fun to solve, I started to solve it regularly. 

If you don't see the solutions of the fifth or sixth kyu, it's because I'm going to upload eight and seventh kyu first.

I will update this page later.
