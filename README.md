I solve(d) 8-7-6 kyu katas when i'm watching a series, videos or playing games so they might not be the best solution. You might want to consider checking other people solutions.

Solutions are solved with Javascript, Java and Python. Starting from kyu 6 i wont use Java to solve katas. (I hope i wont need Java. I'm still learning javascript via solving katas)

I will update this page later.
